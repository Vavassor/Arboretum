# Arboretum

Arboretum is a 3D modeling app for desktop Windows and Linux. It focuses on
modeling, painting, and animating models for games and art.

It is currently a prototype and won't be released anywhere until further notice.

## Building

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org). CMake files can be used directly
by many editors, or can generate files for other build systems, such as Unix
Makefiles. For now, consult a guide for your editor or build system (more
useful explanation coming soon!).
